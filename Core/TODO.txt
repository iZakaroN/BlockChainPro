- Use optimized binary serialization
- Transactions:
  - Signing (Asymmetric) of transactions
  - Validation
- Blocks validation
- P2P sync
- Abstract hash size and algo (use it for different performance/security scenarious)
	- hash size = baseHashSize*2^x (base 128 = 0 , current 256 hash = 1, futureproof hash 512 = 2, 1024 = 3)
	- target bits
