- Use optimized binary serialization
- Fork replay protection
	- add blockchain Id
- Transactions:
	- Chaining
	- Merkel tree hashing
	- Validation
- Blocks validation
	- Signing
	- Validate accepted blocks
- P2P sync
	- Limit number of connections
	- Optimize connections (by best response while ensure that the entire network is connected - always have at least one distant node)
	- broadcast sync - ensure all pears have the same blocks 

- Abstract hash size and algo (use it for different performance/security scenarios)
	- hash size = baseHashSize*2^x (base 128 = 0 , current 256 hash = 1, future proof hash 512 = 2, 1024 = 3)
	- Algo
	- target bits
- Tests
	- Threading sync test
		- Miner
		- Block chain sync
		- Cross checks
- Make it SOLID
	- Define interfaces
	- Single responsibility
	- DI
	- Implement feedback as decorator
- Make it async
- Console command engine ()
- Mining 
	- Separate Miner to serer and client for pool mining
